        <h1>pH from 4 to 5</h1>
        <div id="lmt">
        <p>
            Soil with a pH between 4-5 is still acidic but less extreme compared to lower pH ranges. Here are detailed properties of soil within this pH range:
        </br>
        <u> 1.<strong>Acidity</strong> </u>:The soil remains acidic, with a moderate concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in the soil solution. While less acidic than soils with pH levels below 4, pH 4-5 soils are still considered acidic and may require soil amendments for certain plants.
        </br>
        <u> 2.	<strong>Nutrient Availability</strong></u>: Essential nutrients continue to be less available to plants in acidic conditions. Nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium may be partially bound and less accessible to plants. However, compared to lower pH ranges, nutrient availability may be slightly improved in the pH range of 4-5.
        </br>
        <u> 3.<strong>Aluminum Toxicity</strong></u>: Aluminum toxicity may still be a concern in soils with pH levels closer to 4. Aluminum ions can be released into the soil solution, potentially inhibiting root growth and overall plant health. However, the severity of aluminum toxicity is generally lower compared to soils with lower pH levels.
        </br>
        <u> 4.<strong>Microbial Activity</strong></u>: Microbial activity in acidic soils with pH 4-5 is still relatively low compared to neutral or alkaline soils. However, some acid-tolerant microorganisms may be more active in this pH range compared to lower pH ranges, contributing to organic matter decomposition and nutrient cycling.
        </br>
        <u> 5.<strong>Soil Structure</strong></u>: Poor soil structure may still be a concern in acidic soils with pH 4-5, though it may be less severe compared to lower pH ranges. Organic matter decomposition and clay mineral breakdown contribute to soil compaction, reduced water infiltration, and increased surface runoff.
        </br>
        <u>  6.<strong>Soil Color</strong></u>: Acidic soils in the pH range of 4-5 may exhibit a reddish or yellowish coloration, similar to soils with lower pH ranges, especially in the presence of iron oxides.
        </br>  
        <u> 7.<strong>Plant Growth</strong></u>: Some plants, including acid-loving species like certain types of ferns, heathers, and blueberries, may tolerate soils with pH levels in the range of 4-5. However, many plants may still require soil amendments for optimal growth in this pH range.
        </br>
        <u>  8.<strong>	Soil Testing and Amendment</strong></u>: Soil testing is essential to determine the exact pH level and nutrient status of the soil. Depending on the desired crops or plants, lime or other alkaline materials may need to be added to raise the pH and improve soil fertility.
            In summary, soil with a pH between 4-5 remains acidic but presents less severe challenges for plant growth compared to lower pH ranges. Proper soil management, including pH adjustment and nutrient supplementation, may still be necessary to optimize soil fertility and create a suitable environment for plant growth.
